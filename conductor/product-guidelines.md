# Product Guidelines

## Visual Identity: Classic Vintage
The app embodies a sophisticated "vintage studio" aesthetic. This is achieved through:
- **Muted Color Palette:** Primary use of warm neutrals like cream, beige, and charcoal. Off-white backgrounds are preferred over pure white to simulate aged paper.
- **Classic Typography:** Use of elegant serif fonts (e.g., Playfair Display or Lora) for headings and captions to evoke a sense of history and timelessness.
- **Subtle Textures:** Incorporating light textures that mimic high-end photographic paper or film.

## Visual Effects & Filters
To reinforce the vintage feel, the following effects are prioritized:
- **Subtle Film Grain:** A gentle overlay applied to both the camera preview and the final photostrip to add depth and a tactile quality.
- **Soft Vignetting:** A light darkening of the edges to draw the viewer's eye toward the center of the images.
- **Paper-like Borders:** The photostrip layout uses an off-white, textured background for its borders, avoiding clinical digital whites.

## Tone & Microcopy: Whimsical & Friendly
The app communicates with the user in a lighthearted and celebratory manner:
- **Playful Instructions:** Phrases like "Strike a pose!" or "Making magic..." are used instead of dry, functional commands.
- **Encouraging Feedback:** The UI provides positive reinforcement throughout the capture and development process.

## Interaction & UX: Faded & Gentle
The user experience is designed to be calm and deliberate, matching the soft visual style:
- **Faded Transitions:** Soft fade-ins and fade-outs are used when moving between different stages of the photobooth flow (Camera → Capture → Preview).
- **Spacious Layout:** Generous white space (or "cream space") is used to prevent the interface from feeling cluttered and to keep the focus on the photography.
- **Large, Tactile Controls:** Key actions, especially the capture button, are large and prominent, providing a clear sense of purpose.
